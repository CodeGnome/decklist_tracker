## Purpose

This Ruby on Rails application enables players to track decklists for
*Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013*. The console
versions of the game are terrific, but only allow you to have one custom
version of each deck at a time, and there's no easy way to keep track of
the cards in your sideboard.

## Project Goals

- Make it easy to build custom decklists from the cards available for
  each duel deck.
- Make it easy to see very basic deck information such as number of
  cards and number of lands in each custom deck.

## Contributions Welcome

This is an open-source project. Contributors are highly encouraged to
open pull-requests on GitHub.

## Supported Software Versions

- See [.ruby-version][6] for the currently-supported Ruby versions.
- See [Gemfile.lock][7] for a complete list of gems, including supported
  versions, needed to build or run this project.
